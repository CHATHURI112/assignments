# Grading and Collaboration Policy

## Lab Assignments
All the three lab assignments must be completed to satisfaction (passed) in order to sit for the exam. Coopor

## Projects
The final exam accounts for 60 % of the final grade in the course, while the project grade accounts for the remaining 40 %. For the graded part of the lab, you will be given a grade in the range 0-100 points, which will be translated to a letter grade in the end, after you submit the project report and the oral exam. Projects are done in groups of 3. 

##Plagiarism Warning

Any form of cheating, plagiarism, i.e. copying of another student’s text or source code, will result in the grade F, and immediate disqualification from the course and may be reported to the university for administrative processing. Committing acts that violate Student Conduct policies that result in course disruption are cause for suspension or dismissal from UiS. 

Don’t cheat. It’s not worth it!
